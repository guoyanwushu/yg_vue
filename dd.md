js
width: typescript \ react \ vue \ network \ eslint \ webpack \ git \ webserver \ mobile \ chart \
deepth: vue (if this is enough deep, you can get a good job), and i think is not need too much thing is deepth, just someone is ok

why? the code looks not so much difficult, but why i can not do.as weel as read it is so much difficult.i think is because you don't get the key point,just read some scattered code
it looks some lonely ,nothing happened.

however, we can't accept everything equally,we need to find the key and important ,find the idea is more important, how it is work? if you are the author,what you can resolve it work
normally, or make it greater.

before you do, think a while, think what you need, what can you get!
